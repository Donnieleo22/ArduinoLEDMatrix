# ArduinoLEDMatrix

Alright, this is my first time using Github so bare with me please :)

I know my code could definitely be shortened but I got it complete and it's not going to be used for anything professionally so uhhh idc.
Anyway, the website and the video I linked below helped me a lot when making my code. If anyone needs any help getting this code working just let me know and I can try to help. Also, little thing I remembered, under the Form design tab thats not the form itself (the code), make sure the window size is 640x640 because I found that it sometimes wouldnt set to that even though the size in the properties of the form would be set to that. Anyway, have fun!
